# BikeRentalSystem

The purpose of this application is to provide a platform to help bicycle shop owners 
organise their stock adding bikes to the system and making them available for rent and collection. 
All bikes will be provided with a unique bike id number and their status will be updated to available
as soon as they enter the system, making them easy to locate and keep track of. If a bike gets hired it
will be provided with a unique rental id and its status will be updated accordingly to say it is out on hire.
Not only does the system keep track of all your stock and equipment it also keeps track of your rentals and 
performance to date making it easy to see how you are doing financially and which months are your best. 
It also keeps track of which bikes are most popular giving you the inside track on what your future orders will look like.
